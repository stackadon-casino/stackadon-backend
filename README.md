# stackadon-backend

This project will be recreating my Fullstack Academy Stackadon Project from scratch. I hope to improve my old casino app. My stack will use socket.io to create a live game between the users. This project will use postGres and Sequelize to manage its database. I will also be using express.js to make RESTful routes.
